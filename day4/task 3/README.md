1Ô∏è‚É£ What is DOM Manipulation?
DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation allows JavaScript to dynamically change HTML structure, styles, and content.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Selecting Elements
Elements in the DOM can be selected using different methods like ID, class, tag name, or modern query selectors.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Changing Content
The content inside an element can be modified by updating its text or inner HTML.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Modifying Styles
JavaScript allows changing CSS properties directly, adding, removing, or toggling classes dynamically.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Creating and Appending Elements
New elements can be created and added to the DOM, either inside an existing element or at the end of the document.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Removing Elements
Existing elements can be removed from the DOM, either by deleting the element itself or removing it from its parent.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Events
User interactions like clicks, mouse movements, and key presses can be detected and handled using event listeners.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Form Handling
User input from forms can be collected, validated, and processed dynamically.

9Ô∏è‚É£ DOM Traversal
DOM traversal methods help navigate between parent, child, and sibling elements.

üîü Animations & Effects
CSS properties can be dynamically changed over time to create animations and effects like fading, sliding, or color transitions.
